WooCommerce VAT checker and validator

== Description ==

This simple feature plugin adds a new VAT field to the checkout section and, optionally, checks for any entered value.

It also, optionally, integrates with a third-party service, VATCheck.eu, for VAT number validation.

Using [Vatcheck.eu](https://www.vatcheck.eu/), you can check the VAT number of all European companies. See the [privacy policy](https://www.vatcheck.eu/en/privacy-policy).

Validate your client's VAT number with every sales transaction to a foreign company, this is important to ensure that you exempt the sale from VAT.

If you grant customers exemption without having a valid VAT number, your company risks having to pay the exempt VAT and a fine.
